const name  = "uzair";

let rollno = 49;

var classname = "BSIS";

console.table([name, rollno, classname]);


// const name = "ammar"    we cant change a const variable value

/* we can change the value of let and var variables but we should not use var to declare variables
BECAUSE ITS has block level scope which creates problems so we always use let to declare.*/
